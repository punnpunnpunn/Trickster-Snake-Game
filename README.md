# Trickster-Snake-Game
Snake Game but I'm making it as annoying as possible. Right now I made the controls reversed and the warping completely random. Here are some things I wish to add to this in the future:

- Randomly change the controls in the middle of the game depending on how many food/ what color food you've eaten.
- Have the food move every few seconds
- Randomly rotate the screen
- Have all the rows/ columns move so that the grid is not a square (Imagine staircase-like rows)
- Add annoying graphics off to the side

## If anyone has any suggestions on how to make this game even more annoying let me know.
